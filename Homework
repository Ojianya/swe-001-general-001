IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (IN MY TERMS & UNDERSTANDING)
1). Almost all the equipments that we use, let it be a digital watch or a smart phone or a laptop or a vehicle or a computer or even a television
are based on software and thus software engineering proves to be a better and great career option for all.

2). Software engineers or developers are the creative minds behind computers or programs. Some develop the application software for clients and companies.
Some develop the system software used to run the devices and to control the networks. therefore, a world without software (engineering) engineers is a world headed for damnation.
