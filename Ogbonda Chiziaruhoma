What Is Software Engineering ?

A systematic approach to the analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of software.

Software engineering is the engineering discipline through which software is developed. 
Commonly the process involves finding out what the client wants, composing this in a list of requirements, designing an architecture capable of supporting all of the requirements, designing, coding, testing and integrating the separate parts, testing the whole, deploying and maintaining the software. 
Programming is only a small part of software engineering.
Software engineers develop software applications while focusing on delivering quality software that meets the customers' needs. 
In addition to developing software applications, software engineers select and track the processes that will be used throughout the development of an application. 

Why Is Software Engineering Useful?
it is useful because:

It provides us with the analytical examination skills to identify what a specific software requires (libraries, platform, architecture, etc.) before the first line of code is written.
It allows us to translate end user requirements written in plain English to software requirements in technical terms and also communicate technical advantages or limitations to end users in terms they understand.
