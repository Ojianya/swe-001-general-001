Software Engineering is an engineering discipline of study which deals with the application of systemic principles and approach to the development and management of software.

This involves the application of scientific methods to practical purpose of design, analysis or operation of structure, machines or systems.

Due to the high level of advancement in technology all around the world, the usefulness of software engineering cannot be over-emphasized. Software Engineering is virtually useful in all sectors/discipline of life, country and world at large. These sectors where software engineering is useful include:

i.	Education: Software Engineering has caused a major revolution in the education system in that institutions under this sector are digitalizing almost all processes in the system. Many Information systems/application has been and are still being developed to ease the already existing manual processes.
ii.	Health: Software engineering has brought about revolution in the technologies used in this sector. The devices both sophisticated and non-sophisticated are driven by software and/or programmed chips with are products of software engineering
iii.	Business/Enterprises
iv.	Government
v.	Industries
vi.	Domestic et.c

Software Engineering is useful in very many ways which I may not have pointed out here.
