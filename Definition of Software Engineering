In my own words, software engineering is the appicagion of engineering priciples to software develpoment. In broader terms, it is the process f analyzing user needs and designing and constructing, and testing end user appications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages.
Software engineering is neccessary to become able to build software on time, on budget, within specification while minimizing defects, managing quality, cost, time, complexity, verifiability, maintainability, availability, relaibilty, dependability, performance, security, usuablity, and other attributes of software.
