
DEFINITION

Software Engineering is the application of Engineering techniques to the design, development and maintenance of software. 


IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

1. Reduces complexity

Big softwares are always complex and difficult to develop. Software engineering has a great solution to decrease the complexity of any project. 
Software engineering divides big problems into several small problems.

2. To minimize software cost

Software requires a lot of hardwork and software engineers are highly paid professionals. 
A lots of man force is requires to develop software with millions of codes. 
But in software engineering, programmers plan everything and reduce all those things that are not required. 

3. Productivity

With the help of software engineering, any company can increase its productivity. 
Any project that decrease cost and requires less time always helps to increase company productivity. 
In software engineering, proper care of software productivity is taken because it has testing system at every level.
If programs fails to meet its standard at any stage, then programmers always improves the code of software to make it sure that software maintains its standards.

4. Handling big projects

Big projects are not made in few days and they require lots of patience, planning and management. 
And to invest six and seven months of any company, it requires lots of planning, direction, testing and maintenance. 
No one can say that he has given four months of company to the project and the program is still in its first stage. Because company has given many resources to the projects and it should be completed. 
So to handle big projects without any problem, company has to go for software engineering approach.
