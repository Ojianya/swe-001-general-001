Software engineering is a field of engineering fpr designing and writing programs for computers or other electronic devices.
software engineering can also be defined as the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines. It is relatively a new area of engineering but the scope is extremely broad.



Why is it useful?
- software engineering provides a complete requirements collection.
- provides consistent  user interface
- software engineers create softwares that we use everyday, such as microsoft office, e-mail, games, or anything that involves the use of computer systems or mobile system softwares, thereby proving a better and great career choice
- creates job opportunities and possibility for advancement throughout one's career.
- software engineering reduces complexity of project by dividing big problems into several small problems and solving them one by one to get the final solution.
- helps to minimize software cost by planning and reducing the codes that are not requiredand thereby decreasing time spent and improving productivity.
- ensures a reliable software because testing and maintenance is provided.
